# Searching

JSolr provides a powerful searching experience out-of-the-box; simply type what you are looking for and get back a list of relevant results.

However, there may be times when additional filters or advanced search may enhance the user experience. That's why JSolr provides powerful search capabilities which can be further enhanced through advanced configuration.

Extend JSolr's search capabilities by:

* [Providing an advanced search form for targeted queries and filters](/advanced-search.md)
* [Using dimensions for targeting specific result types](/dimensions.md)
* [Customizing the user experience with JForm XML form definitions](/xml-form-definitions.md)
