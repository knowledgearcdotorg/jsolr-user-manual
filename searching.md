# Searching

JSolr provides a powerful searching experience out-of-the-box where users can simply type what they are looking for and get back a list of relevant results.

However, there may be times when additional filters or advanced search may enhance the user experience. That's why JSolr provides powerful search capabilities which can be further enhanced through advanced configuration.

Extend JSolr's search capabilities by:

Targeting specific result types using dimensions

Customizing the user experience with JForm XML form definitions

## Search XML Form Definitions

With JSolr you can customize the way your users search your web site content.

JSolr uses [Joomla!'s XML form definitions](https://docs.joomla.org/XML_JForm_form_definitions) to provide additional methods of filtering search results; you can even change the search query field if you need a different type of query input.
