# JSolr Form Fields

JSolr provides a list of search-specific form fields for querying, filtering and sorting results. These form fields extend [Joomla!'s existing form fields](https://docs.joomla.org/Form_field), so the syntax should be familar for technical users who have created or edited Joomla! forms.
