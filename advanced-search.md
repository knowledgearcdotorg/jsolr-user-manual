# Advanced Search

Advanced search assists users in building more complex queries which in turn generate more relevant search results.

Advanced search also provides filtering so that users can drill down to specific information, for example only searching for keywords in the title or only searching within PDF documents.

## Customizing the Advanced Search Form

You can add, modify or remove fields from the Advanced Search form to make advanced searching more relevant to your indexed information. For more information, check out the [Advanced Search Form Syntax](/Advanced Search Form Syntax) section of [XML Form Definitions](/xml-form-definitions.md).
